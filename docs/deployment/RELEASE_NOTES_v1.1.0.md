    - `pkg/web/` - Web interface components
    - `pkg/config/` - Configuration management
  - `test/` - Comprehensive test suites
    - `test/integration/` - Integration tests
    - `test/benchmark/` - Performance benchmarks
    - `test/performance/` - Performance analysis tests
  - `docs/` - Documentation organized by purpose
    - `docs/api/` - API documentation
    - `docs/deployment/` - Deployment guides and release notes
    - `docs/development/` - Development documentation
  - `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Removed Redundant Files**: Cleaned up project by removing unnecessary files
  - `delete.xml` - Irrelevant configuration file
  - `project_info.json` - Duplicate metadata

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Build System
- **Standard Go Build**: Improved build process following Go best practices
- **Dependency Management**: Cleaned up go.mod and optimized imports
- **Binary Generation**: Enhanced binary building for multiple platforms

### Testing Framework
- **Structured Testing**: Organized tests by type (unit, integration, benchmark, performance)
- **Security Testing**: Fixed and enhanced security test suite
- **CI/CD Ready**: Improved test integration for automated pipelines

## 🧹 Cleanup and Maintenance

### Removed Files
- Performance test files moved to dedicated test directories
- Duplicate configuration files consolidated
- Irrelevant build artifacts removed

### Documentation
- **Reorganized Docs**: Documentation moved to appropriate subdirectories
- **Release Notes**: All release notes consolidated in `docs/deployment/`
- **API Documentation**: Improved API documentation structure

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. Update import paths to reflect new package structure
2. Use new build commands from `scripts/` directory
